MINIM
-
Designed and implemented by Draven Stedman

This is a minimalistic programming language I'm designing as
a fun little project to keep myself occupied when I'm not writing
music. It's chiefly influenced by Pascal and other Wirth-designed
languages, though it's starting to take inspiration from wherever
I see fit.

This repository holds reference implementations. The plural is due
to the fact that I currently am thinking of attempting to reimplement
the language into a compiled language such as C++ or Pascal, in addition
to the small but in practice somewhat inefficient implementation that runs
on Python. The primary reason for this is that I want to be able to make
the Minim interpreter widespread and efficient. I'm kinda aiming for the
perfect balance of pure, brutalistic minimalism, and usability/flexibility.

You can read the specification, which is changing with every new addition to
the language I add. You can also read the changelog just to be aware of what
is changing with every new version, and in addition you can read the TODO doc
to see what I plan on implementing.

Minim and its' implementations are licenced under the Modified BSD Licence.
See LICENCE for details.
